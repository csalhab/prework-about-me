      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been a Software Engineer for over 20 years. I took a Perl Programming class back in 2000 and before that, I graduated college in 1988.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in the Amazon, in a basin city to the Amazon River called Belem, Para. I moved to the United States 50 years ago and have been a Naturalized Citizen for almost 35 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love baseball and futebol. And I like to play piano and I love photography and Broadway.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To have my own business where I innovate and engineer some service that helps people in some capacity (am still figuring this out).</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, NY.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I started my career as a Web Developer. I prefer working on backend systems like building API's endpoints/services. I studied Computer Science because English is a 3rd language to me, where Portugues is my 1st language. But in the early 70's in the Hudson Valley, there were no Portuguese speaking teachers. So I was assigned a Spanish speaking teacher, who was brilliant. She knew words that were similar in both Spanish and Portuguese and she helped me learn English initially and some Spanish along the way too.</p>
